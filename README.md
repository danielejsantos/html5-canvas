# HTML5 Canvas

###  #JavaScript30

This is the eighth of the 30 day Vanilla [JS Challenge](http://https://javascript30.com/ "JS Challenge") by Wes Bos. The objective of the challenge was to create a canvas with the HTML5 canvas element that users can draw on when they click and drag. The drawing functionality was coded with JavaScript using multiple event listeners(for mousedown, mousemove, mouseup, mouseout) and line style properties.

The **technologies** used were:
- HTML
- JavaScript
